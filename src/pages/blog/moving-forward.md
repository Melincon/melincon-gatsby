Been a while since I have posted on this. Started working a job at this local deli my buddy has been working at for 7 years. I enjoy working their for the most part, certainly have some complaints but what job doesent. Recovery from my ingeniul hernia repair is nearly complete, though I am saved some intermitent pain. As far of dev goes im happy to say that my personal resume site is posted <a href="http://www.travisclaus.com/">travisclaus.com</a> and im pleased with it at the moment. Now I have moved onto building through the Next.js tutorial, that technology is very promising for future plans. Purchased the <a href="http://www.crackafetch.com/">crackafetch.com</a> domain. My buddy has shown interest in my developing a site for him, hes an artist so ill most likely be booting a gatsby that usese netlify cms for the back end. Ohh i just booted my machine up with a new m2 ssd, its sweet.
