Currently working through the mess that I made on my git bash environenment. I did every single step of the process on a branch so I pushed that up to the git hub branch, pulled it over to the master and then pulled the master down to my local master on my machine. Not sure of that is proper practice but it worked. Currently reading though how to host this using the gatsby cloud service. Apparently all I really need is a github repo and firebase which i already have. If it doesent all work out I will talk about what happened in my next post. Also im really hungry at the moment. About to go get halal. Its actually the only thing I eat any more and its helping me gain weight which is nice. Just finished filling in all the latin on my site with actual text. One of the most important things that needs to get fixed is the links to the website pates external to this site. My social links work correctly though the links to my sites leave my website page, which is of course horrible design. Though since... wait as I was writing this I realized my mistake and whent back and fixed it.
