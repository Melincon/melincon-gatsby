So here it is, the very first one. Well the site isent even live yet, though this will be stowed away here untill it launches. I really do love working with this technology, React I mean. This whole process of programatticaly building pages and iterating markdown files to get slugs and working with the gatsby-node.js is really confusing. Though I would love to replicate it for the sites and software pages. Today was an rough day by the way, though what day isent rough for me lately. Could be worse of course. Hopefully im moving forward into a good direction, sure feels like I am. I constantly feel the impeding weight of depression weighing down on me. Not much to do besides press forward. Anyway, I hope to post some really great tech and math things in this blog. This whole site is supposed to be my professional outlet for intellectual facets. Thanks for reading :)
