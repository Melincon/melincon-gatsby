The site is really about where I want it to be. Their are still some things I need to fix/implement. I discarded the about page since reading in images from markdown files is a pain in the buttox. Furthormore I felt uncomfortable posting pics of my friends. I need to fill in all the latin text with something meaningfull and cheesy instead. I need to fix the footer layout since getting it all to center nicely is a real pain for no reason. Then I should start writing these other sites and softwares so that my link pages do not look so empty and boring. I also need to design the 404 page now that I think about it. I also need to implement pagination on all my pages listing things, though I need more things to list before a pagnination design needs to be exercised. Anyway I may deploy very soon so I have something to show. Then move forward from their. I will either be deploying straight to googles hosting or I will be deploying to the hosting servise that is offered free and rediricting from my google hosted domain.
